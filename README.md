# ClientServerProgram

Some Instructions on how it works:You need to insert an already registered account number for the system to calculate the loan amount.There is some dummy data in the loancustomerdata.sql script which can be used.A mysql database needs to be setup, I have provided some sql scripts for the tables.All the loan requests are stored in the userrequests table(I have provided the sql script for creating that table).The server port needs to be configured upon execution.The client ip address and port to connect to also need to be configured upon execution.
